To do application lets users to add some tasks to the list. Users can delete, mark as done their tasks and filter according ti the status.

I used gulp, scss, html and core js to complete this task.
To start the project you need to write on terminal 'gulp'

DONE

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Mobile screen
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos

There is one thing that wasn't clear for me is the cross button. I made it visible when you add a new task to your list.
Also I wasn't be able to change the background on the checkbox mark when it has status checked. It's still has s default colors. Probably I needed to use before, after pseudo-elements there, but unfortunately didn't have enough time.
